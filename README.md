# Music Management System

**A platform specifically built for music bloggers.**

My goal with this system is twofold: 1) Set up a Meteor-based application, 2) Create a blog that can play music (a la new Myspace) while exploring the site.

Because I am building this in my spare time, and I am learning the Meteor and History API while I'm building it, this will be a long and drawn-out process.

## Version 1.0 Goals

- [ ] Admin control panel
- [ ] Post submit
- [ ] Image upload

- [ ] Client-side music player (HTML5), with simple playlist (add new file to end of list)
- [ ] Maintain music while navigating site (History API)

## Version 1.2 Goals

## Version 1.3 Goals
